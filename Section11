Lecture 1:
This is the basic configuration for NGINX. You set up an upstream named educa,
which points to the socket created by uWSGI. You use the server block and add
the following configuration:
• You tell NGINX to listen on port 80.
• You set the server name to both www.educaproject.com and educaproject.
com. NGINX will serve incoming requests for both domains.
• You explicitly set access_log to off. You can use this directive to store
access logs in a file.
• You use the error_log directive to set the path to the file where you will
be storing error logs. Replace this path with the path where you would like
to store NGINX error logs. Analyze this log file if you run into any issue
while using NGINX.
• You include the default uWSGI configuration parameters that come with
NGINX. These are located next to the default configuration file for NGINX.
You can usually find them in any of these three locations: /usr/local/
nginx/conf/usgi_params, /etc/nginx/usgi_params, or /usr/local/etc/
nginx/usgi_params.
• You specify that everything under the / path has to be routed to the educa
socket (uWSGI).

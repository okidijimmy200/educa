Lecture 1:
Adding permissions to views::
REST framework includes a permission system to restrict access to views. Some
of the built-in permissions of REST framework are:
• AllowAny: Unrestricted access, regardless of whether a user is authenticated
or not.
• IsAuthenticated: Allows access to authenticated users only.
• IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly: Complete access to authenticated users.
Anonymous users are only allowed to execute read methods such as GET,
HEAD, or OPTIONS.
• DjangoModelPermissions: Permissions tied to django.contrib.auth. The
view requires a queryset attribute. Only authenticated users with model
permissions assigned are granted permission.
• DjangoObjectPermissions: Django permissions on a per-object basis.

If users are denied permission, they will usually get one of the following HTTP
error codes:
• HTTP 401: Unauthorized
• HTTP 403: Permission denied

****http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/courses/1/enroll/******
--You can access the administration site and check that the user is now enrolled on
the course.

Lecture 2:
Creating viewsets and routers::
--ViewSets allow you to define the interactions of your API and let REST framework
build the URLs dynamically with a Router object. By using viewsets, you can
avoid repeating logic for multiple views.
--Viewsets include actions for the following
standard operations:
• Create operation: create()
• Retrieve operation: list() and retrieve()
• Update operation: update() and partial_update()
• Delete operation: destroy()

--You create a DefaultRouter object and register your viewset with the courses
prefix. The router takes charge of generating URLs automatically for your viewset.

-open http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/ in your browser. You will see that the router
lists all viewsets in its base URL,

--You can access http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/courses/ to retrieve the list of
courses.

Adding additional actions to viewsets::
--You can add extra actions to viewsets. Let's change your previous
CourseEnrollView view into a custom viewset action.

Lecture 1:
Adding permissions to views::
REST framework includes a permission system to restrict access to views. Some
of the built-in permissions of REST framework are:
• AllowAny: Unrestricted access, regardless of whether a user is authenticated
or not.
• IsAuthenticated: Allows access to authenticated users only.
• IsAuthenticatedOrReadOnly: Complete access to authenticated users.
Anonymous users are only allowed to execute read methods such as GET,
HEAD, or OPTIONS.
• DjangoModelPermissions: Permissions tied to django.contrib.auth. The
view requires a queryset attribute. Only authenticated users with model
permissions assigned are granted permission.
• DjangoObjectPermissions: Django permissions on a per-object basis.

If users are denied permission, they will usually get one of the following HTTP
error codes:
• HTTP 401: Unauthorized
• HTTP 403: Permission denied

Building a Chat Server
--In this chapter,
you will build a chat server for students using Django Channels. Students will
be able to access a different chat room for each course they are enrolled on. To
create the chat server, you will learn how to serve your Django project through
Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI), and you will implement
asynchronous communication.

--chapter, you will:
• Add Channels to your project
• Build a WebSocket consumer and appropriate routing
• Implement a WebSocket client
• Enable a channel layer with Redis
• Make your consumer fully asynchronous

Lecture 1:
Creating a chat application::
--You are going to implement a chat server to provide students with a chat room
for each course. Students enrolled on a course will be able to access the course
chat room and exchange messages in real time. You will use Channels to build
this functionality. Channels is a Django application that extends Django to handle
protocols that require long-running connections, such as WebSockets, chatbots,
or MQTT (a lightweight publish/subscribe message transport commonly used
in Internet of things projects
--Using Channels, you can easily implement real-time or asynchronous functionalities
into your project in addition to your standard HTTP synchronous views.

Lecture 2:
Implementing the chat room view::
--You will provide students with a different chat room for each course. You need to
create a view for students to join the chat room of a given course. Only students
who are enrolled on a course will be able to access the course chat room.

--create a template for the course_chat_room view. This template will
contain an area to visualize the messages that are exchanged in the chat and a text
input with a submit button to send text messages to the chat

--open http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat/room/1/ in your browser, replacing 1 with the id of an existing course in the database.

Deactivating the per-site cache::
--You will deactivate the per-site
cache to avoid site-wide caching and only use caching where needed.

Real-time Django with Channels::
--This functionality requires real-time communication between
the server and the client. The client should be able to connect to the chat and send
or receive data at any time.

Asynchronous applications using ASGI::
--to work with asynchronous applications, you need to use another interface called
ASGI, which can handle WebSocket requests as well

--WebSockets provide full-duplex communication by establishing a persistent, open,
bidirectional Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection between servers and
clients. You are going to use WebSockets to implement your chat server.
--When an HTTP request is sent by the browser to the web server, Django handles
the request and passes the HttpRequest object to the corresponding view. The
view processes the request and returns an HttpResponse object that is sent back
to the browser as an HTTP response. There is no mechanism to maintain an open
connection or send data to the browser without an associated HTTP request.

--Channels replaces Django's request/response cycle with messages that are sent
across channels. HTTP requests are still routed to view functions using Django,
but they get routed over channels. This allows for WebSockets message handling
as well, where you have producers and consumers that exchange messages across
a channel layer.

Installing Channels::
****pip install channels==2.4.0**********

--install twist before channel
--Channels expects you to define a single root application that will be executed for
all requests. You can define the root application by adding the ASGI_APPLICATION
setting to your project

-we wil put it in routing.py

Then, add the following line to the settings.py file of your project:
ASGI_APPLICATION = 'educa.routing.application'

--When Channels is added to the INSTALLED_APPS setting, it takes control over the
runserver command, replacing the standard Django development server. Besides
handling URL routing to Django views for synchronous requests, the Channels
development server also manages routes to WebSocket consumers.

--Check that the output contains the line Starting ASGI/Channels version
2.4.0 development server. This line confirms that you are using the Channels
development server, which is capable of managing synchronous and asynchronous
requests.
In order to implement the chat server for your project, you will need to:::
--1. Set up a consumer: Consumers are individual pieces of code that can handle
WebSockets in a very similar way to traditional HTTP views. You will build
a consumer to read and write messages to a communication channel.
2. Configure routing: Channels provides routing classes that allow you to
combine and stack your consumers. You will configure URL routing for
your chat consumer.
3. Implement a WebSocket client: When the student accesses the chat room,
you will connect to the WebSocket from the browser and send or receive
messages using JavaScript.
4. Enable a channel layer: Channel layers allow you to talk between different
instances of an application. They're a useful part of making a distributed
real-time application. You will set up a channel layer using Redis.

Reordering modules and their contents::
--You need to provide a simple way to reorder course modules and their contents. You
will use a JavaScript drag-and-drop widget to let your users reorder the modules of
a course by dragging them. When users finish dragging a module, you will launch
an asynchronous request (AJAX) to store the new module order

Using mixins from django-braces::
--django-braces is a third-party module that contains a collection of generic mixins
for Django. These mixins provide additional features for class-based views

You will use the following mixins of django-braces:
• CsrfExemptMixin: Used to avoid checking the cross-site request forgery
(CSRF) token in the POST requests. You need this to perform AJAX POST
requests without having to generate a csrf_token.
• JsonRequestResponseMixin: Parses the request data as JSON and also
serializes the response as JSON and returns an HTTP response with the
application/json content type.

*******pip install django-braces==1.14.0***********

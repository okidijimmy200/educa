Lecture 1:
Creating a CMS::
--You need to provide the following functionality:
• Log in to the CMS
• List the courses created by the instructor
• Create, edit, and delete courses
• Add modules to a course and reorder them
• Add different types of content to each module and reorder them

Adding an authentication system::
--You are going to use Django's authentication framework in your platform. Both
instructors and students will be instances of Django's User model, so they will be
able to log in to the site using the authentication views of django.contrib.auth.

Creating the authentication templates::
--open http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/

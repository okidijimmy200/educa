Lecture 1:
Creating a CMS::
--You need to provide the following functionality:
• Log in to the CMS
• List the courses created by the instructor
• Create, edit, and delete courses
• Add modules to a course and reorder them
• Add different types of content to each module and reorder them

Adding an authentication system::
--You are going to use Django's authentication framework in your platform. Both
instructors and students will be instances of Django's User model, so they will be
able to log in to the site using the authentication views of django.contrib.auth.

Creating the authentication templates::
--open http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/

Lecture 2:
Creating class-based views
--You are going to build views to create, edit, and delete courses. You will use classbased
views for this.
--When you need to provide a specific
behavior for several class-based views, it is recommended that you use mixins.

Using mixins for class-based views::
--Mixins are a special kind of multiple inheritance for a class. You can use them
to provide common discrete functionality that, when added to other mixins, allows
you to define the behavior of a class.
There are two main situations to use mixins:::
• You want to provide multiple optional features for a class
• You want to use a particular feature in several classes

Working with groups and permissions:::
--You have created the basic views to manage courses. Currently, any user could
access these views. You want to restrict these views so that only instructors have the
permission to create and manage courses.

--Django's authentication framework includes a permission system that allows you
to assign permissions to users and groups. You are going to create a group for
instructor users and assign permissions to create, update, and delete courses

open http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/group/add/ to create new group object.
--name: instructor
--Add the name Instructors and choose all permissions
of the courses application, except those of the Subject model,

--Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/auth/user/add/ and create a new user.
--Edit the user and add it to the Instructors group, as follows:

--Users inherit the permissions of the groups they belong to, but you can also add
individual permissions to a single user using the administration site

Restricting access to class-based views::
--You are going to restrict access to the views so that only users with the appropriate
permissions can add, change, or delete Course objects.

• LoginRequiredMixin: Replicates the login_required decorator's
functionality.
• PermissionRequiredMixin: Grants access to the view to users with
a specific permission. Remember that superusers automatically have
all permissions.

http://127.0.0.1:8000/accounts/login/?next=/course/mine/
--log in with a user belonging to the Instructors group. After logging
in, you will be redirected to the http://127.0.0.1:8000/course/mine/ URL



Lecture 3:
Managing course modules and their contents:::
You are going to build a system to manage course modules and their contents. You
will need to build forms that can be used for managing multiple modules per course
and different types of content for each module.

Using formsets for course modules::
--Django comes with an abstraction layer to work with multiple forms on the same
page. These groups of forms are known as formsets. Formsets manage multiple
instances of a certain Form or ModelForm. All forms are submitted at once and the
formset takes care of the initial number of forms to display, limiting the maximum
number of forms that can be submitted and validating all the forms

--Formsets include an is_valid() method to validate all forms at once. You can also
provide initial data for the forms and specify how many additional empty forms to
display.

--Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/course/mine/ in your browser. Create a course
and click the Edit modules link for it

---The formset includes a form for each Module object contained in the course.
After these, two empty extra forms are displayed because you set extra=2 for
ModuleFormSet. When you save the formset, Django will include another two
extra fields to add new modules.

Adding content to course modules::
--create a view that handles creating or updating
the objects of any content model.

--Run the development server, open http://127.0.0.1:8000/course/mine/, click
Edit modules for an existing course, and create a module

*****python manage.py shell************
>>> from courses.models import Module
>>> Module.objects.latest('id').id
4
--Run the development server and open http://127.0.0.1:8000/course/module/6/
content/image/create/ in your browser, replacing the module ID with the one you
obtained before

Lecture 4:
View for Deleting Content:
--create a ContentDeleteView to delete a particular item.

Managing modules and their contents::
--You have built views to create, edit, and delete course modules and their contents.
Next, you need a view to display all modules for a course and list the contents of
a specific module.

--you could display each item in the template differently based on the type of
content it is.
--we will use a template filter.
--Stop the development server and run it again using the command python manage.
py runserver. By stopping and running the development server, you make sure
that the course template tags file gets loaded.

--Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/course/mine/ and click the Manage contents
link for a course that contains at least one module.
